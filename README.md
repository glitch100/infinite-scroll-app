infinite-scroll-app
===================

Simple and Basic infinite scroll example project in Unity3D.

Outstanding requirements for 0.1::
Collider issue on Deathbar
Some platforms spawning outside of Deathbar Range
Lives Counter not created

Controls::
Right Mouse Click : Enable Amazing Jetpack

Information::
*Drop too far and your velocity will kill you
*You have 5 lives - get shot that many times and die
*Your weapon is crazy good and can destroy the mightiest of foes with a single blow
*Aim for kills and distance for the best score

Story::
The universe has ended and there is only the void. Within, there lies a lone capsule, you, and mysterious platforms with
seemingly happy looking cubes on them. Beware, for these cubes are evil and must be destroyed. See how high you can go in the
void, as there is nothing else to do in this colourless, barren locale.
