infinite-scroll-app
===================

Simple and Basic infinite scroll example project in Unity3D.

Outstanding requirements for 0.2::
Create generic powerup system
Use health instead of damage
Create different enemies

Controls::
Right Mouse Click : Enable Amazing Jetpack, and move mouse left/right to drift.
On Death: Press ENTER to restart

Information::
*Powerups - a familiar friend or deadly foe : BOMB for losing lives, SCORE boost, and 1UPs
*Drop too far and your velocity will kill you
*You have 5 lives - get shot that many times and die
*Your weapon is crazy good and can destroy the mightiest of foes with a single blow
*Aim for kills and distance for the best score
*Enemies shoot faster and spawn more often in order to increase difficulty

Story::
The universe has ended and there is only the void. Within, there lies a lone capsule, you, and mysterious platforms with
seemingly happy looking cubes on them. Beware, for these cubes are evil and must be destroyed. See how high you can go in the
void, as there is nothing else to do in this colourless, barren locale.
