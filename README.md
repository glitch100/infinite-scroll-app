Story::
The universe has ended and there is only the void. Within, there lies a lone capsule, you, and mysterious platforms with
seemingly happy looking cubes on them. Beware, for these cubes are evil and must be destroyed. See how high you can go in the
void, as there is nothing else to do in this colourless, barren locale.
